Hybridization ‚Äî the interbreeding of individuals from populations that differ by one or more heritable characters ‚Äî can be studied to better understand the evolutionary processes associated with speciation, as well as the way species are responding to environmental change. Black-capped and Carolina Chickadees hybridize in a narrow hybrid zone that extends from New Jersey to Kansas, and that is moving northwards at a rate of ~1 km per year (Taylor et al. 2014; Wagner et al. 2020).

**Figure 1:** Map of the Black-capped (blue) and Carolina (red) Chickadee range distributions. The hybrid zone, represented by the area of range overlap (purple), spans from New Jersey to Kansas. Points represent the populations sampled: allopatric Black-capped Chickadees (DNY, INY and HRP; blue circles), allopatric Carolina Chickadees (ECW and LSU; red squares), and sympatric populations (JSP, LHU and DSU; purple diamonds).

Hybrid chickadees have deficient learning and memory abilities compared to either parental species (McQuillan et al. 2018), suggesting that cognition may be a postzygotic reproductive isolating barrier ‚Äî where hybrids with deficient cognitive abilities experience negative selection. To determine if cognition is acting as a post-zygotic reproductive isolating barrier in chickadees, we used high-resolution, whole-genome data to examine patterns of introgression across the hybrid zone and determined the biological processes associated with loci experiencing reduced introgression. We also used whole genome data to determine chickadee ancestry across our hybrid zone transect and compared hybrid zone position to previous studies.

**Figure 2:** Principal component analysis generated from 16,285,686 filtered SNPs (A). To highlight the difference between allopatric Carolina Chickadee (red squares) and sympatric (purple diamonds) populations (B), eight individuals were dropped from DeRuyter, New York (BCCH1-8), one individual from Lehigh University (E456-3), and one individual from Jacobsburg State Park (E451). E456-3 and E451 were dropped because they became isolated from the rest of the samples after dropping BCCH1-8, suggesting E456-3 and E451 may be related.

**Figure 3:** Geographic cline generated from principal component one (Figure 2), which represents 14.32% of the variation in the genomic data. Colored crosses represent the location of populations along the latitudinal transect (Red = allopatric Carolina Chickadee populations, Purple = sympatric populations, Blue = allopatric Black-capped Chickadee populations). The black solid line represents the maximum likelihood cline for the best ‚Äúhzar‚Äù model, and the pink shading around the geographic cline is the 95% credible cline region. The dashed black line and shaded grey region represent the clinal center and width of the hybrid zone, respectively (center: 1149.99 ‚Äì 1156.29 km; width: 23.61 ‚Äì 38.30 km).

**Research Question:** *Does cognitive breakdown in hybrid offspring act as a postzygotic, reproductive isolating barrier in a rapidly moving hybrid zone?*

We found 1) that chickadee ancestry and geographic cline analysis indicated continued northward movement of the chickadee hybrid zone in Pennsylvania (Taylor et al. 2014; Wagner et al. 2020), 2) that genomic cline analysis revealed reduced introgression of loci on the Z chromosome, and 3) that loci experiencing reduced introgression across the hybrid zone are related to cognitive and metabolic function.
